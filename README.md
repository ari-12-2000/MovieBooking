# MovieBooking
1. Developed a full-stack Movie Booking web app using the MERN stack, featuring user, admin authentication, movie bookings and cancellations, adding movies by admin and distinct profiles for users and admins.
2. Implemented server API with Express.js and Node.js, using bcrypt.js for password encryption and JWT for admin authorization before adding movie.
3. Created models and relationships with Mongoose schemas for users, admins, movies, and bookings. Utilized Mongoose sessions and transactions to ensure data consistency in operations involving multiple collections.
4. Enhanced the UI with Material-UI, React Router for SPA , stored movies after
fetching and login details in redux. Implemented movie search and filter features.
